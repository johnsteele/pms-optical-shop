This is a practice management software suite for managing patients and their orders.
The application is built using SWT and JFace. This is NOT an Eclipse RCP application, 
so don't be fooled. Everthing was built to look like an RCP application for 
educational purposes. 
I built it over the summer of 2011. It uses a Derby database for its back-end. 
The Derby database must already be running for it to start. Currently, this is an 
unfinished project; however, it does have a lot of functionality and demonstrates how 
to do many of the common and not-so-common things in Eclipse RCP.
