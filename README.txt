This is a practice management software suite for managing patients and their orders.
I built it over the summer of 2011. It is an Eclipse RCP application, and it uses a
Derby database for its back-end. The Derby database must already be running for it 
to start. Currently, this is an unfinished project; however, it does have a lot of 
functionality and demonstrates how to do many of the common and not-so-common things
in Eclipse RCP.
