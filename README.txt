This is a practice management software suite for managing patients and their orders.
The application is built using SWT and JFace. This is NOT an Eclipse RCP application, 
so don't be fooled. Everthing was built to look like an RCP application for 
educational purposes. 
I built it over the summer of 2011. It is an Eclipse RCP application, and it uses a
Derby database for its back-end. The Derby database must already be running for it 
to start. Currently, this is an unfinished project; however, it does have a lot of 
functionality and demonstrates how to do many of the common and not-so-common things
in Eclipse RCP.
